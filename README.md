# Fiesta
## Inspiration
In today's fast-moving and competitive world, individuals often find themselves overworked. This can lead to feelings of exhaustion, reduced efficiency at work, and mental distance from work. This can lead to capable employees leaving companies which is a disadvantage for the company as they lose out on good employees. To counter this problem, we have built Fiesta a web application that will predict if an employee is overworked or not. If the employee is overworked travel places are suggested for VACATION!

## What it does
Our project, Fiesta is a website that the HR of a company can make use of to understand if the employees in the company are overworked or not.

If the employee is overworked then we recommend you a vacation which you very much deserve. With the travel recommendations, Fiesta is the best place to support a healthy work environment.

## How we built it
We made use of Figma to build the UI of the website. Following this we made the frontend of our website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, We then wrote the backend of our website using Node JS and Express JS. In addition, we built an ML model and deployed it on Heroku using the Flask framework. We then integrated the self-made ML model and a travel API from RapidAPI with the backend of our website. Finally, we deployed our website on Heroku.

## Challenges we ran into
It was our first time making a web development project. Making a website according to our own UI/UX, integrating backend with frontend, working with APIs & even integrating our custom-made ML model was a demanding & challenging task, especially against the constraints of time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to say that we were able to make a beautiful website with its own UI/UX & fully functional from scratch. Writing and integrating backend with frontend, working with APIs & integrating our  ML model in our first web development project is something we are truly proud of!

## What we learned
We learned how to integrate backend with frontend in Web Development, work with APIs & integrate ML model into our website. We learned how to host the ML model, integrate it with the website & host the website itself. Time management & teamwork were two of our greatest lessons.

## What's next for Fiesta
Traveling solo is not very fun, is it? Keeping that in mind we aim to make fiesta into a platform to bring people together and have their vacations. In addition, we want to add mini-games to the website for people to take a small break amidst their work and de-stress. We wish to include a  personal assistant to cater to your needs and a chatbot. We aim to make fiesta into a platform to bring people together and plan their vacations in groups.
